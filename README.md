# SpaceApplication

**Note from Sweny Bagrecha - Android Developer**

- Made use of Clean Architecture structure
- Design Architecture Used: MVVM
- The clean Architecture includes: **Repository, Usecase, Domain, Fragments(UI), Adapters, ViewModels**
- Reusuable functions are included in **Utils**
- Used Safe args to send data as part of navigation between two fragments
- Made use of **BaseActivity, BaseViewModel, BaseFragment** for handling few things such as **ProgressBar, APIerrors**
- Null checks have been taken into consideration
- I have put Method level comments as well to give detail information of what the respective method do. 
- Implemented an **impressive UI**. 
- Please go throught the whole project, run the app, you would be happy to see :)
